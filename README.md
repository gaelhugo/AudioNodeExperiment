   cd audionode-experiment
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash

## 🎮 How to Use

### Basic Audio Flow

1. Every audio connection starts from a source (like an Oscillator) and ends at the destination (your speakers)
2. Connections are made by dragging from an output (right side) to an input (left side)
3. The master output is always available at the bottom right of the workspace

### Quick Start Example

1. Connect Oscillator output → Gain input
2. Connect Gain output → Destination input
3. Click the global "Play" button at the top
4. Adjust the Gain value to control volume
